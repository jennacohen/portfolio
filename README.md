## [Quiz: Are You A Smart Shopper?](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/features/smart-shopping-quiz/)

As food prices have risen due to factors such as inflation, I worked with members of the NewsHour digital and product team to design and develop an interactive web page where users can learn how to best shop on a budget, then take our quiz to test their skills. The interactive led our site for engagement time on a single page during the week following publication. It was also featured on our [broadcast program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emErLPu0-O0&t=12s).

In 2022, one out of 10 South Dakotans didn’t have health insurance, according to the Census Bureau.
