# Jenna Cohen - Work Samples

I’m Jenna Cohen, a visual journalist who can sit at the center of a project and propel it forward.

Below are some pieces that demonstrate my passion for this work and the skills I have.

## [Quiz: Are You A Smart Shopper?](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/features/smart-shopping-quiz/)

As food prices have risen due to factors such as inflation, I worked with members of the NewsHour digital and product team to design and develop an interactive web page where users can learn how to best shop on a budget, then take our quiz to test their skills. The interactive led our site for engagement time on a single page during the week following publication. It was also featured on our [broadcast program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emErLPu0-O0&t=12s).

**My role:**

- Data reporting
- Interface design: Figma
- Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, WordPress

In 2022, one out of 10 South Dakotans don’t have health insurance, according to the Census Bureau. I worked alongside our health reporter to coordinate resources and gather data in South Dakota, visualized data in a static chart and interactive map, and customized the page layout in our CMS to highlight key quotes, photography, and side stories.

**My role:**

Support for abortion rights overall has increased as state legislatures and courtrooms have instituted a growing number of restrictions and bans, according to an April 2023 PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll. I worked with our politics and polling team to visualize our poll data for [our site](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/support-for-abortion-rights-has-grown-in-spite-of-bans-and-restrictions-poll-shows) and [social platforms](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrgyX8JtGpi/?img_index=2).
